**q0**: What is a learning system that is both robust, interpretable and performant?
	**q1**: What is the interface between symbolic systems and connectionist systems?
	**q2**: What is the difference between symbolic systems and connectionist systems?
	**q3**: How to integrate of symbolic systems into deep learning?
	**q4**: What makes symbolic systems interpretable and deep learning not?
	**q5**: Is the distinction between connectionist and symbolic relevant? Is the path towards  q0 through integration between the two methods?
	

> **Robust**: Fail gracefully, or sufficiently adaptable?
> **Interpretable**: The ability to predict behavior in advance.
> **Performant**: Good enough to be useful in a wide range of tasks. Perception, decision    making, reasoning, prediction. Or domains. Computer vision, natural language, reinforcement learning.


Symbolic systems:
- Discrete
- Algebraic / composable
- Structural / hierarchical
- Interpretable
- Representational


- Stiff, fragile, sensitive to error
- Top-down, rigid, fixed

	Examples:
	 - Rule based systems
	 - Expert systems
	 - Programming
	 - Proof assistants

Connectionist:
- Continuous
- Uniform
- Robust
- parallel

- Lacking in structure
- not parallel? (see [Marvin Minsky](https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/SymbolicVs.Connectionist.html))
- Uninterpretable

	Examples:
	 - Neural networks
	 - Brain

- Different in terms of how they handle uncertainty / learning
