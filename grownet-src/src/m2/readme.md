# Model 2

Model 2 is the prelimary test of this whole idea, I don't know why there is no model 1, probably because it sucked. Model 2 just uses regular backprop on a geometric grid of cells which forms a sparse directed acrylic graph implicitly through the way that its designed. The backprop is very vanilla, a straight forward pass and backward pass, consecutive in nature.
